In this project, we propose a novel approach that integrates the adaptive histogram equalization algorithm with deep learning models for image enhancement. The adaptive histogram equalization technique is widely used in image processing to improve the contrast and dynamic range of images. However, it often leads to over-enhancement and amplification of noise artifacts. To address these limitations, we introduce deep learning models that can learn and adaptively enhance the image while preserving its natural appearance and reducing noise.
The project begins with a comprehensive literature review to understand the existing image enhancement techniques and their limitations. Various research papers, journals, and articles related to image processing, adaptive histogram equalization, and deep learning are studied to gain insights into the state-of-the-art techniques and methodologies.
Based on the literature review, we propose a method that combines the traditional adaptive histogram equalization algorithm with deep learning models. The adaptive histogram equalization algorithm is modified to incorporate local contrast enhancement and noise reduction techniques. This modified algorithm serves as the baseline for comparison with the deep learning models.
